        ----------
        shape : tuple of ints
            The shape of the rectangular array of pixels. The ordering of the
            shape is (slow, fast), where fast indicates the direction that is
            most rapidly scanned across when mapping intensities stored in
            a linear memory array onto the camera.
            
        pixel_shape : tuple of floats
            The size of the rectangular pixels that make up the detector, also

            but that you need to be consistent!

            the way someone wants to map pixel intensities (somewhere else in
